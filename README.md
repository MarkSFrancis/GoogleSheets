# Google Sheets

This is a sample project for integrating with the Google Sheets API using API Keys in dotnet.

Google's getting started guide can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/dotnet), with their guide to API key authentication [here](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/get_started#simple).

This repository contains a sample for a console app, server-side blazor, and an azure function. To run these examples, you'll need to generate your own API keys for integrating with the Google APIs (using the above guides), and set them as environment variables on your machine.
